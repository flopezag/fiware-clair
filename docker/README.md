# Executing Docker Scan locally

This is the option when you want to execute locally the scan over some FIWARE GE or over the
complete list of FIWARE GEs.

## Prerequisites

* Docker version 18.09.1 (or newer)
* docker-compose version 1.23.2 (or newer)

## Configuration

The only things that you have to do is download the [container-scan.sh](container-scan.sh) 
file in your local folder to execute the corresponding security scanner over the selected 
FIWARE GE or over the predefined set of FIWARE GEs (see [enablers.json](enablers.json)).

The execution of this script automatically download the following files:
- [docker-compose](docker-compose.yml)
- [default FIWARE GEs](enablers.json)

And it will clone as well the [Docker Bench Security](https://github.com/docker/docker-bench-security) 
folder to make the CIS Docker Benchmark nalyse.

Before launching the script, it is needed to configure the credentials to access to the 
[FIWARE Nexus instance](https://nexus.lab.fiware.org). It will be the place in which we
store the results of the execution of the scan for historical reasons.

## Execution

You can obtain a help description about the execution of the script just executing the 
following command:

```bash
./container-scan.sh -h
```

Which show the following content:

```bash
    Usage: $0 [-pv] [IMAGE_NAME]
    
    Options:
       -p : Pull images before running scan
       -v : Verbose output
       -h : This help message
    
      [IMAGE_NAME] : Optional, Docker image file to be analysed.
                     If it is not provided the Docker images are 
                     obtained from the enablers.json file.
```    

The script will produce 2 files for each FIWARE GE in json format with the format:

```text
<name of ge><date>_<time>.json
``` 

Inside this folder and into the docker-bench-security folder.
